Variational Quantum Algorithms for REYES Summer Program. Slides can be found in [this link](https://jackaraz.github.io/reyes-2024/).

Before getting your hands dirty please install packages in ``requirements.txt``. This can be done by creating a new Python environment and installing everything there with the following script

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

I suggest using Python>=3.8.

## Examples

* Variational Quantum Eigensolver: Ising model ``vqe_ising.ipynb``

    In this exercise, we will try to find the ground state of the Ising model.

* Variational Quantum Eigensolver: Heisenberg model ``vqe_heisenbert.ipynb``

    In this exercise, we will attempt to find the excited state of the Heisenberg model.

**Suggested Projects:** If you like to work on a similar project, you can look into ``project_chemical_potential.ipynb``. This project builds on the non-linear sigma model which you will need to learn about for your final write-up. Hamiltonian is already provided and the project guides you step by step on what to do by using the material learned in other exercises.
